System Design Fundamentals

1. Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal Scaling: Adding more machines to handle increased load
- Vertical Scaling: Adding more resources to existing machines
- Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers
- Caching: Storing frequently accessed data in memory
- Database Sharding: Splitting data across multiple databases

2. High Availability
- Redundancy: Maintaining multiple copies of critical components
- Failover: Automatic switching to backup systems
- Replication: Synchronizing data across multiple nodes
- Health Checks: Monitoring system components
- Circuit Breakers: Preventing cascading failures

3. Microservices Architecture
- Service Independence: Each service runs independently
- API Gateway: Single entry point for all services
- Service Discovery: Finding available service instances
- Event-Driven Communication: Using message queues
- Containerization: Using Docker for deployment

4. Database Design
- ACID Properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
- Indexing Strategies: Optimizing query performance
- Normalization: Reducing data redundancy
- Denormalization: Improving read performance

5. Security Considerations
- Authentication: Verifying user identity
- Authorization: Controlling access to resources
- Encryption: Protecting data in transit and at rest
- Rate Limiting: Preventing abuse
- Input Validation: Preventing injection attacks

6. Performance Optimization
- CDN: Content Delivery Network for static assets
- Database Optimization: Query tuning and indexing
- Caching Strategies: When and what to cache
- Asynchronous Processing: Handling long-running tasks
- Resource Pooling: Efficient resource utilization

7. Monitoring and Logging
- Metrics Collection: System performance data
- Alerting: Notifications for critical events
- Log Aggregation: Centralized log management
- Tracing: Following requests through the system
- Performance Profiling: Identifying bottlenecks
