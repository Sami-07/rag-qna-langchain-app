Elon Musk: Hi, I need help with my RAG project. Can you explain how it works?

Jarvis: Of course! RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines two main components:
1. A retrieval system that finds relevant information from a knowledge base
2. A language model that generates responses based on the retrieved information

Elon Musk: How do I implement the retrieval part?

Jarvis: For the retrieval part, you'll need to:
1. Create embeddings of your documents using a model like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
2. Store these embeddings in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS)
3. When a query comes in, convert it to an embedding and find the most similar document chunks

Elon Musk: What about the generation part?

Jarvis: For generation:
1. Take the retrieved relevant documents
2. Pass them as context to a language model (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4)
3. The model will generate a response that's grounded in the provided information
4. This helps ensure the responses are accurate and up-to-date

Elon Musk: Thanks! This is very helpful.

Jarvis: You're welcome! Let me know if you need help with any specific implementation details.
