# RAG Project with MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI and LangChain

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using MongoDB Atlas for vector storage, OpenAI for embeddings and language models, and LangChain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline. It provides a simple web interface using Gradio to query and extract information from documents.

## Features

- Document storage and retrieval using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with LangChain integration
- OpenAI embeddings for semantic search through LangChain's OpenAIEmbeddings
- Question answering using OpenAI's language model via LangChain's RetrievalQA
- Simple web interface built with Gradio
- LangChain-based document processing and retrieval pipeline
